"I need you to write a problem description and dataset description section for an academic machine learning paper. I'm working on Hidden Markov Models for emotion recognition from speech audio using the RAVDESS dataset.
Please follow these instructions:

First, carefully read through the two writing style guide files I've provided in this workspace
Analyze the writing patterns, tone, mathematical rigor, and structure from these guides
Write a problem description that explains why emotion recognition from speech is important and challenging
Write a dataset description for RAVDESS that includes technical details about the data structure
Use the same academic tone, mathematical precision, and clarity as shown in the style guides
Include at least one figure/table describing the data as required by the assignment
Structure this as it would appear in a academic ML paper (similar to the style guides)

The RAVDESS dataset contains emotional speech from 24 actors across 8 emotions (neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, surprised) with filenames encoded as Modality-VocalChannel-Emotion-Intensity-Statement-Repetition-Actor.wav.
Please be iterative - examine the .md files first, then write the sections."

For the RAVDESS paper reference:
The original RAVDESS paper is:
"The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS)" by Livingstone & Russo (2018), published in PLOS ONE.
