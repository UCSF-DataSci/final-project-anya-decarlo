# Part 3: Hidden Markov Model Implementation for Emotion Recognition

**Objective:** Implement the Hidden Markov Model algorithm for speech emotion recognition using the preprocessed RAVDESS dataset.

## 1. Setup

Import necessary libraries.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

```

## 2. HMM Core Algorithms

Implement the three core algorithms for Hidden Markov Models as described in the Rabiner tutorial.

```python
def forward_algorithm(observations, A, B, pi):
    """
    Implement the forward algorithm (Problem 1 in Rabiner tutorial).
    Calculates P(O|λ), the probability of observation sequence given model parameters.
    
    Args:
        observations: Sequence of observations (T x D)
        A: State transition probability matrix (N x N)
        B: Emission probability matrix or function (N x M)
        pi: Initial state probability distribution (N)
        
    Returns:
        alpha: Forward probability matrix (T x N)
        log_likelihood: Log probability of observations given the model
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # 1. Initialize alpha[0, i] = pi[i] * B[i, observations[0]]
    # 2. Induction step: alpha[t, j] = B[j, observations[t]] * sum(alpha[t-1, i] * A[i, j])
    # 3. Termination: P(O|λ) = sum(alpha[T-1, i])
    
    return np.array([]), 0.0  # Replace with actual implementation
```

```python
def viterbi_algorithm(observations, A, B, pi):
    """
    Implement the Viterbi algorithm (Problem 2 in Rabiner tutorial).
    Finds the most likely sequence of hidden states given observations.

    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # 1. Initialize delta[0, i] = pi[i] * B[i, observations[0]]
    # 2. Recursion: delta[t, j] = max(delta[t-1, i] * A[i, j]) * B[j, observations[t]]
    # 3. Backtracking to find best path
    
    return np.array([]), 0.0  # Replace with actual implementation

```python

    """
    Implement the Baum-Welch algorithm (Problem 3 in Rabiner tutorial).
    Adjusts model parameters A, B, pi to maximize P(O|λ).
    
    Args:

    Returns:
        A: Optimized state transition probability matrix
        B: Optimized emission probability distribution

    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # 1. Initialize model parameters randomly
    # 2. E-step: Calculate forward and backward variables
    # 3. M-step: Re-estimate A, B, pi
    # 4. Evaluate log likelihood and check for convergence
    # 5. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or max iterations
    
    return np.zeros((N, N)), None, np.zeros(N)  # Replace with actual implementation
```

## 3. Emotion-Specific HMM Training

Train individual HMM models for each emotion category.

```python
def train_emotion_hmm_models(observation_sequences, emotion_labels, n_states=5, n_iter=100):
    """
    Train separate HMM models for each emotion category.
    
    Args:
        observation_sequences: List of observation sequences
        emotion_labels: Corresponding emotion labels
        n_states: Number of hidden states for each HMM
        n_iter: Maximum number of iterations for training
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping emotions to trained HMM models
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # 1. Group observation sequences by emotion
    # 2. For each emotion:
    #    a. Initialize a GaussianHMM model
    #    b. Train the model on all sequences of that emotion
    #    c. Store the trained model
    
    return {}  # Replace with actual implementation
```

## 4. Emotion Classification

Implement the emotion recognition system using the trained HMM models.

```python
def classify_emotion(observation_sequence, emotion_models):
    """
    Classify an observation sequence by finding the emotion model with highest likelihood.
    
    Args:

        emotion_models: Dictionary of trained HMM models for each emotion
        
    Returns:
        predicted_emotion: The emotion with highest likelihood
        log_likelihoods: Dictionary of log likelihoods for each emotion
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE

    # 2. Return the emotion with the highest likelihood
