Course project guidelines
The goal of the course project is to simulate a situation where you aim to accomplish some task but may need to use machine learning (ML) methods that you aren't familiar with yet. In this course, we have provided a mathematical foundation for you start learning ML methods on your own. For the course project, your job is to find a dataset, decide what question you are trying to answer using this dataset, select an ML algorithm that could help answer your question but not one that you have learned already, learn how the algorithm works, and then apply it.
Your data analyses may be conducted in any language (Python, R, or something else entirely).
Deliverables:
•	Deliver a 5-minute class presentation
o	Due date: Half of the presentations will occur on 6/2. The other half of the presentations will occur on 6/9. Dates will be randomly assigned.
o	Present a brief tutorial of the ML algorithm you have proposed to apply and explain how it will help answer your research question. 
o	Each of you will be randomly paired with someone presenting on the other date. On the day you are an audience member, your role is to ask your partner a question relating to their project [Please don't tell the presenter what you plan to ask in advance]. On the day you are presenting, your partner will ask you a question.
o	Be prepared to answer any other questions as well from your classmates, TAs, and instructor. 
o	Submit slides (pdf or pptx or keynote) to the CLE
o	Suggestions:
	Your goal is to teach your classmates something new! Pictures are often your best friend for communicating an idea in a short amount of time.
	Avoid showing code on the slides. Minimize the amount of math, but be ready to answer questions about the math!
	Practice and time yourself!
•	Submit a final written report
o	Due date: 6/9
o	Describe the problem and dataset. (1 page)
	Include at least one figure/table describing the data.
o	Describe the ML algorithm you will use to analyze this dataset (1 page)
	Explain why this algorithm is appropriate for solving the problem of interest.
•	Things to consider: What assumptions does the algorithm make? When does this algorithm perform well?
	Explain how this algorithm works, both in prose and using mathematical expressions. What are the mathematical concepts that underly this algorithm?
o	Present and discuss results from applying this algorithm (1 page)
	Include at least one figure/table highlighting the results.
o	Submit report (pdf) to the CLE
