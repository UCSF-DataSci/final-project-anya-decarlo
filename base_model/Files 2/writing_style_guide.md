# Academic Writing Style Guide for DATASCI 224 Final Project

## Abstract Structure
- "In predictive modeling applications, it is often of interest to determine the relative contribution of subsets of features in explaining the variability of an outcome."
- "It is useful to consider this [concept] as a function of the unknown, underlying data-generating mechanism rather than the specific predictive algorithm used to fit the data."
- "We demonstrate on simulated data that our method is both accurate and computationally efficient, and apply our method to [relevant domain]."

## Introduction Patterns
- "Machine learning-based techniques are increasingly used to [describe relevant application domain]."
- "Understanding the importance of measured features in prediction may make such algorithms more interpretable."
- "[Algorithm/method] have been very effective in complicated domains, but existing [approaches] suffer from two major drawbacks: they (1) [first limitation], and (2) [second limitation]."
- "To address these issues, we use the [specific approach]."
- "This paper makes [number] contributions. First, [contribution 1]. Second, [contribution 2]."

## Problem Definition
- "Consider the random vector (X = (X1, ..., Xp), Y) with probability distribution P over X × R, where X denotes the possible realizations of X, and the outcome, Y, is a real-valued variable with a natural ordering."
- "We measure the importance of {Xj}j∈s for any s ⊆ {1, ..., p} under the distribution P."
- "Denote the [specific mathematical concepts] with respect to distribution P based on the full set and a reduced set of features as [equation]."
- "We may interpret [equation] as [conceptual explanation]."

## Method Description
- "We now present a computationally efficient method for [specific task]."
- "Let Θ(q) be the set of all possible parameters for [algorithm] with q input nodes and one output node."
- "More specifically, we propose using a [specific architecture/approach] to approximate the [target estimand]."
- "Rather than [standard approach], we train a single [model] to jointly learn the [target] using [technique]."
- "The [technique] tends to be advantageous when [specific condition], which is clearly true in our case: [explanation]."

## Mathematical Notation Style
- "µP(x) := EP(Y | X = x) and µP,s(x) := EP(Y | X(−s) = x(−s))"
- "The variable importance of {Xj}j∈s is Ψs(P) := ∫{µP(x) − µP,s(x)}² dP(x) / VarP(Y)"
- "For convenience, let Φs(P) denote the numerator of (1)."
- "Plugging in µ̂, µ̂s and the empirical variance, our final estimator (3) simplifies to [equation]"
- "If (i) [first condition], (ii) [second condition], and (iii) [third condition], then [resulting property]."

## Results Presentation
- "We demonstrate empirically that our method accurately estimates [target] and yields [performance metric] with asymptotically correct coverage."
- "Table [#] presents the baseline characteristics of the training and testing datasets after [preprocessing] along with the [statistics] obtained through [method]."
- "Classification results are presented in Table [#]. [Algorithm] demonstrates slightly better performance than [alternative] in distinguishing [classes], with testing precision of [value] and recall of [value]."
- "The [performance metric] of [value] further confirms the algorithm's robustness."
- "However, the marginal difference in evaluation metrics between the two models suggests that [interpretation]."

## Discussion Structure
- "Further exploration of alternative methodologies or feature engineering techniques could potentially offer more improvements in classification accuracy."
- "To account for the possible violation of [assumption] among [variables], future models can consider relaxing the [assumption] and exploring the use of more flexible methods such as [alternatives]."
- "Although [algorithm] provides a more flexible [property] by allowing [mechanism], this is done at the cost of potential [drawback], especially with [specific condition]."
- "Careful consideration of trade-offs between [factor 1] and [factor 2] is crucial in algorithm selection."

## Reference Style
- "[Concept]. [Source Author], [Publication Date]. Updated [Date]. Accessed [Date]."
- "[Author] et al. [Title]. [Journal]."
