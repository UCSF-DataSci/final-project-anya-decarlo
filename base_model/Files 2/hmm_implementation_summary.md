# HMM-Based Emotion Recognition Implementation Plan

This document provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing and evaluating a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) system for speech emotion recognition using the RAVDESS dataset. The implementation follows the academic structure outlined in the course project guidelines and incorporates concepts from Rabiner's HMM tutorial.

## Project Overview

The implementation consists of four modular parts:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing** (hmm_part1_data_loading.md)
   - Loading the RAVDESS dataset audio files
   - Basic data exploration and structuring

2. **Feature Extraction** (hmm_part2_feature_extraction.md)
   - Extraction of MFCC features
   - Extraction of prosodic features (pitch, energy)
   - Creation of observation sequences for HMM training

3. **HMM Implementation** (hmm_part3_model_implementation.md)
   - Implementation of forward algorithm (Problem 1)
   - Implementation of Viterbi algorithm (Problem 2)
   - Implementation of Baum-Welch algorithm (Problem 3)
   - Training emotion-specific HMM models

4. **Evaluation and Results** (hmm_part3_evaluation.md)
   - Performance metrics calculation
   - Cross-validation implementation
   - Visualization of results
   - Parameter sensitivity analysis

## Key Mathematical Concepts

The implementation is grounded in the following mathematical foundations from Rabiner's HMM tutorial:

1. **HMM Definition**: λ = (A, B, π)
   - A: State transition probability matrix
   - B: Emission probability distribution
   - π: Initial state probability distribution

2. **The Three Fundamental Problems**:
   - Evaluation: Computing P(O|λ) using the Forward algorithm
   - Decoding: Finding the optimal state sequence using the Viterbi algorithm
   - Learning: Adjusting model parameters using the Baum-Welch algorithm

3. **Gaussian Emissions for Continuous Observations**:
   - Using multivariate Gaussian distributions to model emission probabilities for acoustic features

## Implementation Schedule

1. **Week 1**: Data preparation and feature extraction
   - Load and explore RAVDESS dataset
   - Implement and test feature extraction functions
   - Visualize extracted features across emotions

2. **Week 2**: HMM core algorithm implementation
   - Implement forward, Viterbi, and Baum-Welch algorithms
   - Train initial models with small subsets of data
   - Debug and optimize algorithm implementations

3. **Week 3**: Full system training and validation
   - Train emotion-specific HMM models on complete dataset
   - Implement cross-validation framework
   - Tune model parameters (states, covariance types)

4. **Week 4**: Evaluation, visualization, and report preparation
   - Generate comprehensive performance metrics
   - Create visualizations for the report
   - Prepare academic report following course guidelines

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Working Code**: Complete implementation of the HMM-based emotion recognition system
2. **Academic Report**: Following the three-section structure from the course guidelines:
   - Problem and dataset description (with data visualization)
   - HMM algorithm description (with mathematical expressions)
   - Results presentation and discussion (with performance tables/figures)
3. **Presentation**: 5-minute tutorial on HMM application to emotion recognition

This roadmap ensures a systematic approach to implementing the HMM algorithm for speech emotion recognition while adhering to academic standards and course requirements.
