Honestly? You’ve already built a solid, technically sound project.

If your new project is a continuation or reframing, you could:
	•	✅ Try more states (4-, 5-, 6-state HMMs) and use log-likelihood to justify the best model — like your professor did.
	•	✅ Run the same evaluation (F1, confusion matrices) on the new best HMM.
	•	✅ Add a short discussion on how increasing state depth affects prediction quality and generalization.
	•	✅ Optionally add PCA/regularization and compare again



    Your extension plan is sensible and technically feasible. A quick feasibility-check and a few practical pointers:

Deeper-state HMM sweep (4/5/6 states)
• Easy: you already expose --n_states in run_hmm_pipeline.py.
• Model-selection metric: log-likelihood is fine, but consider BIC or AIC to penalise extra parameters; can be added with one line once you have logL, N_params, N_obs.
• Over-fitting risk: 1 440 utterances × 200–600 frames each is plenty, but variance rises fast with 6-state × GMM. Stick to single-Gaussian at first.
Hybrid “HMM → Viterbi path features → RF/SVM”
• Conceptually sound; analogous to “HMM-SVM tandem” used in speech/gesture.
• Implementation:
– After Viterbi, derive per-utterance feature vector. Common choices:
• π̂ (empirical initial-state one-hot) – len = K
• State frequency vector – len = K
• K×K transition count matrix flattened – K² features
• Normalised entropy of path, mean run length, etc.
– With K≤6 you’ll get ≤42 features, perfect for tree-based or SVM models.
• Cross-validation hygiene: you must Viterbi-decode within each CV train fold and pass only those derived features to the downstream model; otherwise leakage occurs.
• Classifier choice: RF is quick, SVM (RBF) often works better with small dense vectors; grid-search C, γ. Use weighted F1 for scoring.
Evaluation & reporting
• Keep k-fold CV consistent across both stages so you can run paired t-tests on fold scores.
• Confusion matrices of pure HMM vs. hybrid will illustrate where hybrid helps (often happy/sad/fearful).
• Add table: states × metrics + hybrid row.
Code changes scope
• Minor edits to evaluator.cross_validate_hmm to return per-utterance Viterbi paths.
• New module hybrid_classifier.py (~100 lines) that:
– builds feature vectors,
– performs CV grid-search over RF/SVM,
– outputs metrics/plots.
• Update README “Experiments to run” accordingly.
Risks / mitigations
• Limited data per emotion: use stratified CV, maybe speaker-independent split to test generalisation.
• High K: keep eye on singular covariances; you already add min_var safeguard.
In short, both the deeper-state sweep and the hybrid pipeline align well with the existing codebase, demand only incremental additions, and will produce clear quantitative evidence for performance gains (or lack thereof). Let me know when you’d like me to sketch the code hooks or expand the README to include this planned study.
